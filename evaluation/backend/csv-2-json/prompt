create this backend application in Node.js or Flask

In the JSON2CSV application you translated JSON to a comma separated value (CSV) format. The objective of CSV2JSON is to reverse that process by converting a block of CSV text to JSON.

In CSV2JSON you'll start by copying the JSON2CSV app you created and then modify it to allow CSV to JSON conversion as well the JSON to CSV conversion that's already present. In additional to providing a useful function, this challenge will also give you practice in modifying existing applications to add new functionality.
